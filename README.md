# Counter-up-and-down-for-5-bits
-5-bit counter - Count Value loaded from "IN" port on a positive clock edge when "Load" signal is high, Load has highest priority - Count value incremented by 1 on a positive clock edge when "Up" signal is high. - Count value decremented by 1 on a positive clock edge when "Down" signal is high, Down has higher priority than "Up" signal - Increment stops at 31 - Decrement stops at 0 - "High" flag active high whenever count value is 31 - "Low" flag active high whenever count value is 0
